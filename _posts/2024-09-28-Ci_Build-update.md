# Broken Builds
Usually its in the .css/.scss file where my [build breaks](https://github.com/ricoThaka/compiling/actions/runs/11040779623/job/30784563669). i was porting some old code from BubblegumPop, a repo my friend an spouse uses to do something with her girlfriends when social media breaks... Now im being asked for new functionality bc `actions/upload-artifact@v4 or later` is not present. I had to add to the Buildfile and now the site and 3 other sites are not complaining and accepting new MarkDown and MarkUp [i shared a cheetsheet below ](#MArkDown-QuickFacts).

`Artifacts allow you to share data between jobs in a workflow and store data once that workflow has completed.`

Like a pussy i turned off linting. it was really helping me grow as an [HTML PRogrammer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) some argue its not a [Programming Language](https://github.com/resources/articles/software-development/what-is-a-programming-language) theres just different types and HTNL is a [Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language). From my understanding at this point [MarkDown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is just a collapesed subset that reducses the steps to publish text to device. Like theres no [KramDown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) object or [Video]() without knowing [LiquiD](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/)
